    <p>
      There are buffers for most primitive data types such as
      <code>FloatBuffer</code>, <code>IntBuffer</code>, etc. These classes
      provide methods to get and put data from the
      buffers, to compact, slice or duplicate them, or to wrap an existing
      array. Buffers also manage the position of the current element in the
      buffer, they can be rewound to the beginning and allow skipping of elements.
