  <p>
    The java.text package allows to uncouple the text in an application 
    from natural languages.
  </p>
  <p>
    By using the classes in this package, it is possible to write the
    application in an unlocalized way. The benefit of this is that a new 
    localization can be provided at any time without having to change the 
    code. Support for localization is given for numbers, messages, dates and 
    other characteristics of a language like the directionality, sorting order
    or enumeration of characters, words or lines.
