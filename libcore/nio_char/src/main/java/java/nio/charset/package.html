      This package provides translation services between bytes and different
      character sets.
    </p>
    <p>
      An encoder translates characters into bytes and a decoder can
      translate a byte stream into characters. With a charset you can create a
      de-/encoder pair that can be used to translate a byte stream. With the
      service provider package it is possible to use your own charsets.
