    <p>
      This package provides a preferences mechanism, that is, a means of writing
      configuration data (key/value pairs) to a persistent data store and
      retrieving it from there. There are two different kinds of stores
      available: one for storing user data and one for storing system
      configuration data. Since the underlying implementation is dependent
      on the operating system, this package is designed to allow the installation
      of a custom service provider implementation.
